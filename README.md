# Task-Organizer-Final-Project
The Task Organizer Application is designed for students, professionals, and anyone looking to manage their daily tasks efficiently. It is a lightweight tool to help users plan, prioritize, and track their activities while providing a simple, user-friendly interface.

# Description
The application will allow users to:

    Add Tasks: Create tasks with descriptions, deadlines, and priorities.
    Edit Tasks: Modify task details, such as deadlines or priority levels.
    Delete Tasks: Remove completed or outdated tasks.
    Sort Tasks: Organize tasks by priority, deadline, or creation date.
    Search and Filter: Search for specific tasks or filter them by categories or completion status.
    Progress Tracker: Display visual progress (e.g., percentage of completed tasks).

# What ADTs and Algorithms are used?

    ADTs:
        ArrayList: To store tasks dynamically.
        HashMap: To associate tasks with categories or priorities.
        PriorityQueue: For sorting tasks by priority levels.
        Heaps: As implemented into priority queue.

    Algorithms:
        Sorting Algorithms: To order tasks by deadlines or priorities (e.g., Merge Sort or Quick Sort).
        Search Algorithms: To implement task search functionality (e.g., Binary Search for sorted lists).
        Custom Comparators: For sorting tasks based on user-selected criteria.
